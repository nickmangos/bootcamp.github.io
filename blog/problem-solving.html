      <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way… (I’m a genius!)</h4>

      <p>
        I can’t think of a specific example, but if I’m ever blocked and my code
        isn’t doing what I expect, the first tool I reach for is something
        called console log. This is an instruction to the computer for it to
        print out a message to the screen depending on what the code is doing at
        the time. Using this I can see behind the scenes at what my code is
        doing at each stage, so that I can catch any mistakes or fix my
        expectations of how the code acts.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a great way of not only problem solving, but increasing your own
        understanding of JavaScript. It feels good to make visible the hidden
        processes. I’m comfortable using it and sometimes add it in before
        running into problems to make sure I am on the right track as I write
        new code.

      <h4>Got blocked on a simple problem… (Oh no!)</h4>

      <p>
        I was working on a test where I had to write a small program that was
        supposed to write out a certain message on-screen using console log. It
        seemed to be doing what it was supposed to do but the test wasn’t
        passing. I spent twenty minutes trying different things to get it to
        work, including looking at a sample solution and pasting part of it in
        place. As a last ditch effort, I added a full stop to the end of the
        message and it passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Puzzled, I looked at the test requirements and it didn’t have a full
        stop, but as I dragged the window wider a full stop appeared into view.
        The window was perfectly sized to hide the full message and there wasn’t
        a scroll bar to indicate that there was a hidden full stop. Also,
        compounding the confusion, the sample solution also didn’t have a full
        stop, so copying and pasting didn’t help.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was very confusing and it doesn’t feel good to get stuck when you are
        making good progress. I learned that it is sometimes valuable to
        methodically review the requirements of a problem. Even though my
        problem solving didn’t work, I feel confident that they would be useful
        in different situations. I also consider this issue niche as normally
        you would be able to see behind the certain and see what the
        requirements are in the code.
