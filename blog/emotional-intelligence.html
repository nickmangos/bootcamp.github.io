      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence pertains to the perception, identification,
        management and expression of emotions. So much of our day to day lives
        are governed by emotion, our own or others, and a focus on emotional
        intelligence hopes to better prepare us for a world viewed through this
        lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where EQ focuses on emotion, IQ is a measure of intelligence across
        multiple competencies. IQ was once considered the most important trait
        for success in life, but more recently, the importance of EQ has been
        found to have just as much, if not greater effect on a persons success.
        While IQ is still very important, someone with low emotional
        intelligence might struggle to leverage their IQ to its full potential.
        As IQ and EQ both play an important role in our success, it is important
        to foster growth in both areas for best results.
