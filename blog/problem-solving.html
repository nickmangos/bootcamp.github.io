      <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way… (I’m a genius!)</h4>

      <p>
        I can’t think of a specific example, but if I’m ever blocked and my code
        isn’t doing what I expect, the first tool I reach for is something
        called console log. This is an instruction to the computer for it to
        print out a message to the screen depending on what the code is doing at
        the time. Using this I can see behind the scenes at what my code is
        doing at each stage, so that I can catch any mistakes or fix my
        expectations of how the code acts.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a great way of not only problem solving, but increasing your own
        understanding of JavaScript. It feels good to make visible the hidden
        processes. I’m comfortable using it and sometimes add it in before
        running into problems to make sure I am on the right track as I write
        new code.
      </p>

      <h4>Got blocked on a simple problem… (Oh no!)</h4>

      <p>
        I was working on a test where I had to write a small program that was
        supposed to write out a certain message on-screen using console log. It
        seemed to be doing what it was supposed to do but the test wasn’t
        passing. I spent twenty minutes trying different things to get it to
        work, including looking at a sample solution and pasting part of it in
        place. As a last ditch effort, I added a full stop to the end of the
        message and it passed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Puzzled, I looked at the test requirements and it didn’t have a full
        stop, but as I dragged the window wider a full stop appeared into view.
        The window was perfectly sized to hide the full message and there wasn’t
        a scroll bar to indicate that there was a hidden full stop. Also,
        compounding the confusion, the sample solution also didn’t have a full
        stop, so copying and pasting didn’t help.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was very confusing and it doesn’t feel good to get stuck when you are
        making good progress. I learned that it is sometimes valuable to
        methodically review the requirements of a problem. Even though my
        problem solving didn’t work, I feel confident that they would be useful
        in different situations. I also consider this issue niche as normally
        you would be able to see behind the certain and see what the
        requirements are in the code.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques
        and process:
      </h4>

      <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
      <p>
        This is a great way to scaffold a complex problem and iron out some
        logic problems early on. I generally only do this for the harder
        problems.
      </p>

      <h4>Trying something</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes I’ll throw in some hard-coded variables if my code isn’t
        working as expected. This simplifies things and allows me to focus on
        the trouble code.
      </p>

      <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
      <p>
        I just finished debugging some code by describing the problem to
        somebody (not a duck). It’s a great way to catch fallacies, but you have
        to be quite methodical.
      </p>

      <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
      <p>
        I’m not always great at understanding the information contained in an
        error message. Data such as line number don’t always seem to match up if
        you are using a library, but error messages have been helpful in the
        past.
      </p>

      <h4>Console.logging</h4>
      <p>
        This is my problem-solving bread and butter. A great way to make sure
        your code is acting as you would expect and very flexible.
      </p>

      <h4>Googling</h4>
      <p>
        Sometimes is the best way to break through a block, if you know what to
        ask. Sometimes if you aren’t on the right track, it can still give you
        ideas on how to re-approch the problem.
      </p>

      <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
      <p>
        This is my last ditch option, but can be great for these problems that
        have you stumped and are chewing up your time. It often also signals
        that you have an area that you can revisit/reflect on to improve your
        understanding.
      </p>

      <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to asking your peers, but the real big guns. Again, I am
        reluctant to ask others, but it’s important to reach out if you are
        spinning your wheels.
      </p>

      <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
      <p>
        So important. If I have trouble with a piece of code, I’ll write it down
        and revisit the concepts again later to make sure that I’m improving in
        the areas I am weakest in.
