      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>

      <p>
        Same answer as previously. My long term goal is to improve my skills as
        a Product Designer/Developer and to gain the ability to self-publish
        projects. Ultimately I would like to build my own products.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h3>

      <p>
        My strengths remain my curiosity, analytical thought and creativity.
        After completing Foundations, I think I’m also relatively self aware and
        can course correct quickly which helps me overcome challenging problems
        and reevaluate my learning approach. I have a passion for problem
        solving at every level so even if I’m frustrated, I enjoy the process
        once I am doing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can also be a terrible procrastinator, and a perfectionist, which
        makes it worse. During Foundations, I have tried to not over polish some
        of my work and let “good enough” be enough. I also can feel some
        background anxiety can cause me to rush through learning exercises and I
        have to force myself to work more methodically to make sure I am gaining
        the learning competencies and to make fewer time wasting errors.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h3>

      <p>
        A core component of my lesson plan will be front loading the course work
        as much as possible to best stay on top of the course work and not put
        undue time pressure on myself. This will also let me balance my health
        to the best of my ability.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>

      <p>
        I would like to work on my leadership skills and also the giving and
        receiving feedback, which is such an important part of the development
        process.
      </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>

      <p>
        To provide a good learning environment for the cohort and to help
        cultivate a great culture.
      </p>

      <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>

      <p>
        To keep on top of my course work by front loading work and identifying
        blockers as early as possible. To review leaning competencies along the
        way and to note weaknesses in my understanding to address. If I am
        blocked or struggling, to reach out to member of my cohort or if
        necessary, a facilitator. If I’m worried about how I am handling the
        Bootcamp at a personal level I can discuss this with my Human Skills
        facilitator at our 1:1.

      <h2>Learning Plan <span>v1</span></h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately I would like to improve my skills as a Product
        Designer/Developer. To have the ability to self-publish my own work in
        the product space and better participate in the conversation. I am also
        interested in game development.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am curious, analytical and creative. If I am interested in something I
        am learning about I’ll dive into all aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can be a perfectionist which can slow down my output and can lead to
        procrastination, especially if I feel overwhelmed. It’s important that I
        identify any blockers early to prevent this.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>Public speaking, teamwork, leadership, mentorship.</p>

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>

      <p>
        I intend to front-load my coursework to reduce time pressure, allow time
        for additional stretch work. To evaluate my learning goals at the the
        start and end of every day and every week to make sure I am achieving
        what I want to achieve. Be respectful and empathetic to others needs and
        restrictions. Make sure to meet deadlines/commitments and work in a way
        that doesn’t block my peers.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>

      <p>
        Communicate early if workload is getting on top of me or if I feel I
        have bitten off more than I can handle. Take a moment to evaluate my
        work load and make sure I am spending my time and effort in the most
        effective way.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        Depending on the block, reach out on Slack to the facilitators or fellow
        team members and ask for help.
      </p>

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        Help when I am blocked, feedback on my progression and any shortcomings
        in my learning. Advice on learning objectives.
