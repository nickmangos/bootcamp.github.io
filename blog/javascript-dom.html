      <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the fundamental building block of
        the web. We write basic webpages in HTML and if written correctly, HTML
        can communicate to computers just as well as it can communicate to
        humans. But even well written HTML is a little bland, which is where CSS
        (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in. If HTML is the building block, CSS is
        the paint. You can change look of HTML using rules written in CSS,
        making webpages look better and even make the information easier to
        understand.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life
      </h3>
      <p>
        So if HTML is the information and CSS is the style, what if you want to
        add some more interactivity or logic to you webpages? This is where
        JavaScript come in. Javascript is like the brain of a webpage; you can
        write instructions that change the way a webpage acts by default. You
        could spend time writing hundreds of simple instructions and JavaScript
        will follow them all in order, but what makes JavaScript really powerful
        are the ways that you can change this order, called the Control Flow.
        You can loop sets of instructions and you can choose different sets of
        instructions to run based on different factors. Using an example from
        real life, say I want to water all my house plants. The instruction to
        water a single plant might looks like this.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill watering can with water.</li>
        <li>Test soil to see if it is dry enough to require water.</li>
        <li>If it is dry, pour in enough water to saturate the soil.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With these instructions, you would water the plant if it needs it. If
        the soil is already damp, you wouldn’t follow the third instruction.
      </p>
      <p>
        But say you wanted to water all of your plants. You can simply follow
        the second and third instructions for every plant in your house.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Fill watering can with water.</li>
        <li>Test soil to see if it is dry enough to require water.</li>
        <li>If it is dry, pour in enough water to saturate the soil.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every plant.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In Javascript, this would be called a loop. Instead of writing the same
        two instructions for each plant, you loop through these instructions for
        each plant. Imagine if you owned a plant nursery and had to water
        thousands of plants! You wouldn’t write instructions for each plant, you
        would simply loop through the same steps until all the plants were
        watered. If you discover a plant that doesn’t need watering, you would
        ignore step 3 and move on to the next plant. This is how control flow
        works in JavaScript.

      <h3>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript interacts with a webpage using something called the DOM
        (Document Object Model). The DOM is a tree of all the elements of a
        webpage and where they fit in the hierarchy. Using the plant nursery
        again as an example, a table might have three pots on it and in each pot
        is a plant. If you were to consider the hierarchy using the Document
        Object Model, Each plant would be a child of a pot and the post would be
        a child of the table, which in turn would be a child of the nursery.
      </p>

      “Image of plant DOM”

      <p>
        But in a webpage, the elements could be images, headings and paragraphs
        of text within a document. If a paragraph had a link, the link would be
        a child of the paragraph, which in turn would be a child of the webpage.
        You can view the DOM of a webpage using something built into Web
        Browsers called Dev Tools.

      <h3>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </h3>
      <p>
        You can access items within an array using zero-based indexing, where
        the first item in an array is [0]. Objects contain properties consisting
        of key/value pairs and you can access these using bracket and dot
        notation to return the values associated to a key.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are defined sets of instructions. They can take input and act
        on this data to return an output. They decrease repetition and they can
        be used to house certain logic to make a program more understandable.
