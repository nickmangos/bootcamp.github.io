      <h2>Bad advice for positioning elements</h2>
      <p>
        Positioning elements is simple once you understand that of the
        positioning properties of relative, absolute and fixed, in most
        instances, you only need the fixed property. Combined with media
        queries, you can have complete control of the placement of any element
        on your page. Fixed positioning removes the element from the normal flow
        of the document, instead fixing it relative to the initial containing
        block, normally the body of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see how with fixed positioning, you can dictate exactly where an
        element is on a page. You don’t have to worry about elements affecting
        one another as they are no longer in the normal flow of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Absolute positioning is similar to fixed positioning in that it is
        removed from the normal document flow, but is instead positioned
        relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. This is problematic as
        ideally you want the elements positioned relative to the body of the
        document, but any children of a fixed element will be positioned
        relative to it, if you use absolute positioning, so stick to
        fixed positioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last and worst of the positioning properties is the relative
        property. With relative positioning, the element is left in the normal
        flow of the document (I know…) and positioned relative to itself. The
        space allowed for it in the document remains in place, no mater its
        placement. You can see how this would quickly become unmanageable.
