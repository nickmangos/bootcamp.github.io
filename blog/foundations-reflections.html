      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as
        a result of the core learning?
      </h3>

      <p>
        That I often rush through problems in an attempt to solve them quickly,
        causing me to overlook solutions that would be evident if I took the
        time to be more methodical.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m often blocked my the idea of writing, but once I’m in the flow it
        can be enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>Writing about myself often feels contrived and self-indulgent.</p>

      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>

      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        Your values shape your experience in the classroom, which is why it is
        important to take stock of yourself and clarify what your values are. In
        doing so, you can gain clarity on how to best approach the learning
        process to make use of your strengths and what areas you need to focus
        on.
      </p>

      <h3>Empathy</h3>
      <p>
        Programming is ultimately, about people. You are working in teams of
        people to write software for people to use. The classroom is also people
        centric. Being empathetic is to be better able to work effectively with
        and for others.
      </p>

      <h3>Self awareness</h3>
      <p>
        Learning how to code comes with a host of challenges and how we react to
        these challenges can affect the outcome, so it’s important to cultivate
        and build self awareness. It allows us to better self correct and to
        identify areas in our leaning that can be improved.
      </p>

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

      <p>
        I was most surprised by the amount I got out of it. Focusing on on
        writing alone has helped me loosen up and the words flow easier than at
        the start of Foundations. The importance of mindset is something I have
        overlooked until now. I think it’s been valuable to review my mindset
        during the learning process and I think it’s helped me to approach
        harder problems with more confidence.
      </p>

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

      <p>
        Even though I feel more improved in my writing, I still find the process
        daunting. Something about the softness of it; there being no true answer
        and a multitude of ways to approach any piece of writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also found it hard to focus on myself and to write on my experiences
        and values. Again, it feel self indulgent to to dig into and expand on
        myself as a person. It feels like its impossible to not editorialise as
        you try to twist your experiences into words on the page and the final
        product often feels contrived to me.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much
        time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Because coding can be taught relatively easily with time and effort, but
        it is harder to cultivate the soft skills that are valued in the
        workplace. Employers would much rather hire a development candidate with
        strong soft skills and a good culture fit that a strong coder with weak
        soft skills.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>

      <p>
        I don’t think it was a waste of time. I feel like the concept of a
        growth mindset alone is full of value, let alone the focus on self
        awareness and problem solving. We could have spent the time learning
        code, but Core has given us tools to better approach the challenges of
        programming and development, which will likely lead to better results.
        It will also better prepare us for the challenges you will find outside
        of the code editor.
