      <h2>Identity and Values</h2>
      <p>
        A quote that best summarises my core values is from Robin Williams in a
        60 Minutes tribute to his friend and mentor, Jonathan Winters. When
        asked what he had learned from Jonathan, he responded that “The world is
        open for play, that everything and everybody is mockable, in a wonderful
        way.” In
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yVOd9TXNks">a video essay</a>,
        Evan Puschak explores this, saying “…it suggests rightly, that humanity
        and our shared reality is made up of fluid elements of language and
        social structures which are sometimes codified into rules and pressures
        and laws, but that even the most rigid feature of what man makes can be
        turned flexible again and malleable again and funny, with play.”
      </p>

      <p>
        These first 6 words, “The world is open for play” have always stuck with
        me and carry multiple meanings. One is that we should always test and
        question the things around us. To look at life from different angles and
        be open to reevaluating our understandings. Another is a reminder that
        we exist in this space and time and we have this life to work with, that
        we can act upon the world and make of it what we will. It’s about
        approaching the beautiful absurdity of the world and all the forces
        acting upon it with a certain lightness. That we can forge our own paths
        outside of convention; that we don’t have to slot into place.
      </p>

      <p>
        More succinctly, I define my core values as curiosity, empathy, and
        creativity. When asked, people closest to me reenforced these as being
        my values. (!) Thirst for knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        A time that challenged my core values was when I worked in retail for
        one of the telecommunication companies. There were two young customers
        who were interested in signing onto phone plans as they came with free
        handsets. I was worried that the plans were larger than what they needed
        and they would end up paying much more over the life of the contract.
        Also, I was concerned they weren’t taking the contract seriously.
        Ideally, I would have spoken more candidly about my concerns but I felt
        caught by my responsibilities to my employer, as well as whether it was
        appropriate to question their request. In hindsight, I wish I had done
        more to make sure they were making a good decision. Although I was
        empathetic to their situation, I didn’t act on it and although I had a
        responsibility to my employer, I didn’t push back against the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know how my culture has influenced my values. I’m mindful that
        I’m privileged to have grown up in a middle-class family and that my
        value system might be a product of freedom that accompanies that. I
        would say that my personality type as described by the Myers–Briggs Type
        Indicator has a greater influence. When I first tested as INTP and read
        through the profile it was uncanny how it aligned with my experiences.
        While I remain skeptical of the value of the system, I do feel it
        provides some insight or at least a bedrock for introspection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strengths of the INTP, which are listed as being analytical,
        original, open-minded, curious, objective, all ring true and are
        compatible/overlap with my stated values. They are also good qualities
        in a web developer, partially being analytical and curious.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weakness are listed as disconnected, insensitive, impatient,
        dissatisfied, perfectionistic. Dissatisfaction and perfectionism often
        trip me up, locking me in moments of decision paralysis and
        procrastination.

<!-- Louise
Nick’s personal values are so obvious in the way he lives his life from day to day. One of the things I love most about him is his curiosity and thirst for knowledge. If someone mentions something in passing that Nick doesn’t understand or isn’t familiar with, he will jump down a research rabbit hole and then come back with amazing anecdotes and a thorough understanding of the topic (which he breaks down into really easy to understand pieces, helping others to wrap their heads around it). 

He is kind, and generous. This extends beyond the people in his inner circle and out to the world - he is empathetic, and cares about impacts of decisions, policy and environment on all people. He makes ethical decisions - from the small (recycling, a focus on low consumption) to the big (deep interest in international politics and making strong decisions with his vote). 

Nick is also really funny. I don’t know that it’s a value of his, but he makes me laugh out loud every single day. 

His strengths are innumerous (I may be slightly biased) but in particular his curiosity; his practical brain; his calm stoicism around decision making and crisis-situations; he is a great communicator. Nick is all-round the best person i’ve ever met, and he makes me want to be a better human. 

His limitations are really only one thing: his belief in himself (and his time-management).
