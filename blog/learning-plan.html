      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately I would like to improve my skills as a Product
        Designer/Developer. To have the ability to self-publish my own work in
        the product space and better participate in the conversation. I am also
        interested in game development.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am curious, analytical and creative. If I am interested in something I
        am learning about I’ll dive into all aspects of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can be a perfectionist which can slow down my output and can lead to
        procrastination, especially if I feel overwhelmed. It’s important that I
        identify any blockers early to prevent this.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>Public speaking, teamwork, leadership, mentorship.</p>

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>

      <p>
        I intend to front-load my coursework to reduce time pressure, allow time
        for additional stretch work. To evaluate my learning goals at the the
        start and end of every day and every week to make sure I am achieving
        what I want to achieve. Be respectful and empathetic to others needs and
        restrictions. Make sure to meet deadlines/commitments and work in a way
        that doesn’t block my peers.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>

      <p>
        Communicate early if workload is getting on top of me or if I feel I
        have bitten off more than I can handle. Take a moment to evaluate my
        work load and make sure I am spending my time and effort in the most
        effective way.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        Depending on the block, reach out on Slack to the facilitators or fellow
        team members and ask for help.
      </p>

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
      <p>
        Help when I am blocked, feedback on my progression and any shortcomings
        in my learning. Advice on learning objectives.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
