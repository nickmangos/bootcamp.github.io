      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <h3>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people
      </h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity describes the way the nervous system but particularly
        the brain can adapt, learn and recover from injury. As it pertains to
        leaning, neuroplasticity describes how experiences reorganise and build
        neural pathways in the brain. Just understanding the principles of
        neuroplasticity can be beneficial in many aspects of a persons life by
        allowing you to engage with the learning process in a more meaningful
        way, building and strengthening neural pathways ways that improve your
        knowledge, skills and relationships.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your own benefit
      </h4>
      <p>
        One of the more important ways you can improve your neuroplasticity is
        by cultivating a growth mindset. The way you approach the learning
        process effects the way you learn and a growth mindset enhances growth
        and strengthening of neural pathways. Simply understanding that the
        brain remains adaptable past childhood and recontextualizing challenging
        material not as proof of inadequacy, but instead opportunities for
        growth can have a positive effect on your ability to overcome learning
        challenges.
      </p>
      <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
      <p>
        Some ways to improve your neuroplasticity are… Repetition of material:
        Strengthen and link exiting neural pathways. Specificity: Focusing on
        the right material for best effect. Intensity: Higher intensity of
        learning allows for increased growth. Salience: The training has to be
        meaningful for best effect. Transference: Change in function as a result
        of a training experience can lead to learning other similar skills.

      <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
      <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h4>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is trust in the idea that you can learn and adapt
        overtime. That struggling with a problem isn’t proof of inadequacy, but
        the process of improving your mind. A growth mindset helps prime your
        brain to better engage with challenges of the classroom, where a fixed
        mindset can lock down when it encounters a blocker.
      </p>
      <h4>
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I was already familiar with the concepts surrounding neuroplasticity but
        the idea of a growth mindset alone is a powerful tool, especially
        considering the difficulty of the challenges we will expect to face
        during Bootcamp. How will you integrate growth mindset into your
        learning journey? I will incorporate it into my reflections at the end
        of exercises, making sure that I approached the challenge with a growth
        mindset in every facet.</p>

      <h3>
        Blend with your learning plan and strategies - Reflect and discuss how
        these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and
        strategy.
      </h3>
      <p>
        On gaining a greater understanding of neuroplasticity and the concept of
        a growth mindset, I can see opportunities to better apply myself to the
        material by approaching the concepts in a more structured way and making
        sure I have understood the key pillars before moving forward. By doing
        so I can benefit from increased transference of experience. I can also
        make sure to repeat material in areas that I am having trouble with,
        therefore growing and strengthening the neural pathways associated with
        the concepts. Finally and most importantly, making sure to constantly
        review my process to make sure that I am approaching challenges with a
        growth mindset.
